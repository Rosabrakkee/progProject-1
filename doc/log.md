# First weekend
Worked a lot on the drag function. Was a lot of work to get it to work. jQuery was very useful. 
Found [Economic data API](https://data.oecd.org/api/sdmx-json-documentation/) which I will probably want to use.

Encountered some issues with the datamap update function. Apparently the data isn't properly updated by the updateChloropeth function. Will need to look into this.

Drag funtion is fully functional. All I need is a a working secondary plot to show this.

Finished the technical implementation of the data map and it's interactivity. Buttons can now change the data shown on the map and the colors are distinguishable. Started work on the scatter plot. It is now statically functional, but should be easily extended to accept additional countries and change the data shown.
