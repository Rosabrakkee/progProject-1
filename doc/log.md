# First weekend
Worked a lot on the drag function. Was a lot of work to get it to work. jQuery was very useful. 
Found [Economic data API](https://data.oecd.org/api/sdmx-json-documentation/) which I will probably want to use.

Encountered some issues with the datamap update function. Apparently the data isn't properly updated by the updateChloropeth function. Will need to look into this.

Drag funtion is fully functional. All I need is a a working secondary plot to show this.
