# Design
## Data sources
* [GDP and other economic factors](https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm)
* [Happy planet index](http://happyplanetindex.org/)
* [The inclusive internet index](https://theinclusiveinternet.eiu.com/)
Data sources should be indexed on the country they belong to. All of these datasets are already ordered on the country theey belong to, so this should be fairly easy.

## Technical components
* TODO

## List of libraries
* [D3-datamaps](http://datamaps.github.io/)
* [D3-tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip)
